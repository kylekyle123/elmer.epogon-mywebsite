            <br />
            <p>
              HTML is a powerful language for creating websites, applications,
              and other experiences. It is a good way to start learning how to
              create websites, as it is relatively easy to learn and understand.
              With HTML, you can create sophisticated and interactive webpages,
              and you can also use it to create dynamic experiences. By learning
              HTML, you can create webpages that can respond to user input, use
              animation and graphics, and interact with databases.

            <p>
              Bootstrap is a powerful, open source front-end framework for web
              development. It's an easy-to-use tool for creating responsive
              designs and developing websites quickly. With Bootstrap,
              developers have access to a wide range of components and tools
              that make creating custom websites a breeze. Bootstrap includes
              HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components that can be used to create
              responsive, mobile-friendly websites. Bootstrap is popular for its
              clean and consistent design, as well as its wide range of
              components and tools.

            <p>
              JavaScript is the language of the web. It is used to create
              dynamic web applications, create interactive experiences, and
              enhance webpages with animation and dynamic content. With its
              powerful features and capabilities, JavaScript can be used to
              create engaging user experiences and powerful web applications.
              For new web developers, learning JavaScript can be intimidating.
              The syntax of the language can be difficult to understand and the
              concepts of programming can be confusing.
